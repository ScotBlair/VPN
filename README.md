<h1>ProtonVPN - Hiding our IP address</h1>
This tutorial outlines the simple process of using a VPN to conceal our IP address when working remotely in order to improve security.<br />

<h2>Environments and Technologies Used</h2>

- Microsoft Azure (Virtual Machines/Compute)
- Remote Desktop
- ProtonVPN
<br />

- I start by navigating to [whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com/) in my web browser, in which it lists my IPv4 address along with my City, Region, and Country.

- I then open up ProtonVPN, where my current IP address is also displayed, and Quick Connect to a server.

- After the VPN has established connection, I refresh the page in my web browser and observe the changes.  We are now in France.

- I then navigate over to google and am immediately hit with a wall of text, all of it in either French or Dutch, as both of these languages are used in this particualr region.
